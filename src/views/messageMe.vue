    q: `greetings

a few days ago I had a order with you sent to an amazon counter location at whole foods. but they wanted something more than a QR code so it got returned to amazon.

I was talking with a friend who got their amazon order delivered to an amazon counter at some small shop that did not have a locker and they said only a QR code was  needed to pick up their order.

So maybe if you only choose independent stores instead of large chains like Whole Foods the amazon counter locations could be an option. That would be nice if we could try some smaller alternative amazon counter locations. Perhaps calling the location to confirm where they individually require for delivery of amazon packages would be an option. If you get even 1 counter location in say each of the top 25 large cities, or maybe just in cities that you most commonly have customers picking up items in, and those locations accept just a QR code, then you could at least offer Amazon counter locations at just those select locations or something. i'm just spitballing here, but I really love your service. It's excellent but being able to get large items would really kick up the amount of money you could make, I would think.

    q: `Hi, I love your venture! Despite not a customer, I routinely check your update and I hope you have great success.

There's one term I hope you can clarify though: when you mention you have 5,500 USD revenue, are you actually talking about Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV_?

Revenue and Gross Merchandise Volume, (GMV) are two distinct financial metrics that businesses use to measure different aspects of their performance.

1. **Revenue**: This refers to the income that a business earns from its normal business operations, typically from the sale of goods and services to customers. Revenue is the top line or gross income figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income. In the case of a company that sells goods or services directly to customers, the revenue is simply the total amount of money received from those sales.

2. **Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)**: This refers to the total value of all transactions of goods or services sold through a particular marketplace over a specific time period. This metric is often used by online marketplaces, such as e-commerce platforms, where the platform itself does not sell its own goods or services but facilitates transactions between sellers and buyers.

The key difference between the two lies in what they measure and include. Total Transaction Volume includes the total value of all transactions, regardless of who ultimately receives the money. Revenue, on the other hand, only includes the money that the company itself earns, which could be a fraction of the total transaction volume if the company operates a marketplace model and earns revenue through fees or commissions.

    in USD regardless of the purchase amount? How does one make the deposit/ where do the funds sit? And after order is purchased how long until deposit is received back and XMR credited? 
    It says if a dispute you will need login info …. As in user ID and password to the earners AMZ acct, is that right? And what about shipping issues or returns, how is that handled?  
    Sorry for the lengthy questions, just want to make sure ai understood the FAQ’s and any nuances`,
    a: `Wow this is a great question!
    <ol>
      <li>Deposits are made on our site at the earner tab. 
      Yes the deposit system works as you have said. We hold the funds until both sides are happy and we release the funds. The earner deposits 5 USD.</li>
      <li>We push the receiver to respond within a day of them receiving the item so that we can release the funds to the earner.</li>
      <li>Yes we handle disputes that way. The earner does not support refunds. The shopper has to handle that on their end since the order should be marked as a gift.
        All issues will be handled according to who is in the wrong. If the earner completed their end as they were instructed they will not be punished.
        If there is a shipping issue out of control of the shopper or earner we will consult and see what both parties would like. That could result in
        a new order being made, or a refund to both parties.  We have not had any issues yet, but if we do we will write a post- mortem of the situation to 
        document how edge cases were handled.</li>

    q: `Hi, I'm in Japan but I want to order from Amazon.com USA, is it possible to deliver to Japan amazon locker?`,
    a: `Shoot me another message here with the item you want and I will look into it for you!`
  },
{
    q: `Definitely interested for you service in europe, and particularly France.
I  hope that your service will at least survive in the US, cheers.`,
    a: `Thanks for the support. I can deliver to amazon lockers in France. Just place an order and I will work it out for you!`

{
    q: `Hello, I live in Australia. AFAIK ProxyStore <https://dys2p.com/en/index.html> only forwards parcels to German addresses, your service only delivers to amazon lockers in the US and <https://purse.io/> does not support amazon lockers. 
    Do you have any recommendations on similar services or privacy-respecting parcel forwarders that ship to Australia?`,
    a: `I focused just on the United States at launch to start small, but I will consider expanding to Australia if you would like to be my first
    international customer. If you wish to try out my services just submit an order. If I can't provide you with a good service, I will simply refund you. If you have a problem filling out the form, just place in fake info, and that we can have a private chat where we can work on your order. `
  },
  {
    q: `I found you through the Monero subreddit on Reddit. It is interesting that you can pay for Amazon products with Monero and receive them in your Amazon locker. Do you have plans to support Amazon.co.jp for that? I would like to use this service in Japan!`,
    a: `Thanks for the support! I would love to expand globally eventually but now I only support US Amazon. Given that I am based in the usa, I would have to do more research into ordering amazon lockers in other countries. My app has chat built in once you pay for an item, I do not support sessions at this time.`
  },
  {
    q: `Ok so you have your own app for this service? Download from Google store?`,
    a: `Hi. I only have a web app for my services. If you want to place an order you can place an order in the orders tab. Here is a demo video of how it works:
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al7NJsf_fAU`
  },
  {
    q: `Hello buddy! I placed an order but couldnt send the xmr in time
          When i put the 4 words nothings comes up, should i just redo the order?`,
    a:`Hi. You should not refresh the page. It will take you to the correct page once you pay. There is a button at the bottom that says something like "Refresh Amount Sent", you can hit this button to check and once your payment is received the page will automatically take you to the correct page. You should not refresh the payment page.
        The app does not store your shopping cart, till you pay for privacy reasons. So you must place the order again. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me another message.`
